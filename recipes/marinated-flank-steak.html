        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. 
            It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: 
            Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, 
            and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Marinade</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steak</h4>

            <ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper

                <li>Add flank steak to the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. 
                    Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.</li>
